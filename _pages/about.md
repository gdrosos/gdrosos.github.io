I'm a [Direct Doctorate](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html) student at the Department of Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Switzerland. I am privileged to be part of the [Advanced Software Technologies Laboratory](https://ast.ethz.ch/), under the guidance of Prof [Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/).

My academic journey began at the Athens University of Economics and Business, where I earned my Bachelor’s Degree with distinction in 2022 from the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst). Since 2021, I've been a member of the [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/index.html), led by Prof [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.en.html).
During my involvement with the lab, I also had the opportunity to work as a Research Software Engineer at the [FASTEN Research Project](https://www.fasten-project.eu/view/Main/), as well as in the [SecOPERA Project](https://secopera.eu/).

My research interests involve Software Ecosystems, Software Testing, Programming Languages and Program Analysis.
